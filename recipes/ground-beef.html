            <h2>How to Make Life-Changing Ground Beef</h2>
                <p>This recipe is simple and requires very few ingridients.
                    Best results are found using a cast-iron skillet.  You
                    will bring your skillet to a medium-high heat on the stove.</p>

                    <p>Next, you will put the ground-beef into the skillet (1-lb
                    recommended).  Once your ground-beef has started to cook, season
                    generously with salt, pepper, chili powder, and cayenne pepper.
                    It is important to start breaking the ground beef up using a 
                    spatula at this time.  Keep the pieces of ground beef moving.
                    Now, you want to make sure that all of the water from within
                    the beef has boiled out.  The beef may look done at this point,
                    but I can assure you it is not.  Water boils at 212 degrees fahrenheit.
                    You need more heat than that to capture all of the flavor. What we
                    are looking for is called the Maillard Reaction.  This is where
                    the ground beef crispens and darkens a bit.  This is where all
                    the flavor is at.  Once the majority of your ground beef has 
                    gotten a crispy, brown outside to it, you are all done.
